Elegance Install Instructions for Ubuntu 11.10 64-bit(Oneiric Ocelot)

LAMP Installation Instructions 

Install LAMP

We employ a LAMP(Linux, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL, PHP) system to host our MySQL server containing databases created by Elegance.  Although these instructions were written for Ubuntu 11.04 they are applicable to 11.10 as well.  Please follow the guide written by Falko Timme (ft@falkotimme.com) to complete this step.

Install Java 7 JDK (Oracle)

Oneiric Ocelot will automatically install Open JDK 6 for you.  However, we strongly suggest using the Java 7 JDK.
	
	Download the file jdk-7-linux-x64.tar.gz from Orace (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html)

	Extract the contents of the downloaded file to your home folder  I renamed the folder java-7-oracle.  Next  	move the extracted folder to /usr/lib/jvm/

	  cd
	sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm/ #just in case
	sudo mv java-7-oracle/ /usr/lib/jvm/


	Next, install the update java package by Bruce Ingalls

	  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install update-java

	
	Select the new version of Java you moved to your /usr/lib/jvm/ folder (/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle)

	 sudo update-java

	
	Check that you are now running Java 7 

	java -version
       javac -version


Install Elegance

	Move the Folder named “Elegance” to your Desktop.  This folder will contain all of the files necessary to 	run Elegance not including a MySQL server and Image Files.

	The start file will reads as: 
 	
	#!/bin/bash
	cd /home/mxu/Elegance
	java -classpath mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar:Elegance.jar -Xmx7000m -Xss16m Elegance

	Edit The 2nd line of the start file to reflect the directory containing the Elegance folder.  Adjust -Xmx to 	reflect your computer capabilities.

	The configuration.tx file reads as:

	# Elegance User 

	***usernames
	# 
	# Database Name 
	***mysql database names
	# 
	# Database Server 
	***database server IP address
	# 
	# Database Username 
	***username
	# 
	# Database Password 
	***password
	# 
	#  



Create an Image Directory

	We suggest creating a directory separate from the Elegance folder to contain your image files.  We 	create a z drive for this purpose.  

	Open a terminal and type in the following commands:

	sudo mkdir /z
	sudo chmod -R 777 /z
