For steps on setting up a MySQL server please consult the ubuntuinstall instructions.


Perform any necessary updates to your computer

	Click on Apple Icon → software update

Update to the latest JAVA JDK

	Note:  You must sign up for a free Apple Developer account if 		you have not already  
	Go to the following website and download the most recent JDK for 		your specific version of OS X

	http://developer.apple.com/java/download/

	After downloading, go to your download directory and run the 		installer for your recently downloaded JDK

Disable Previous Versions of JAVA

	Go to Applications → Utilities → Java Preferences

	Make sure that only the most recent version of Java is enabled.  	To double check this you can type “java -version” into a 		terminal .

Install Elegance

	Move the Folder named “Elegance” to your Desktop.  Create a 		shortcut on your desktop for easy opening of the elegance 		program.  You can do this by creating a launcher pointing to the 	“start” file within the Elegance 
	directory.

	The start file will reads as: 
 	
	#!/bin/bash
	java -classpath  -Xms1000M -Xmx14000M -cp lib/Elegance.jar/:lib/mysql-connector-java-5.1.18-bin.jar:lib/jai_codec.jar
	:lib/jai_core.jar:lib/vecmath.jar:lib/j3dcore.jar:lib/j3dutils.jar:lib/j3dcore-ogl.so Elegance

	Edit The 2nd line of the start file to reflect the directory containing the Elegance folder.  Adjust -Xmx to reflect your computer 	 	capabilities.


The configuration.txt file is displayed below.  Make the necessary edits to match your MySQL server setup.

Create an Image Directory

	We suggest creating a directory separate from the Elegance 		folder to contain your image files.  We create a Z drive for 		this purpose.  

	Open a terminal and type in the following commands:

	sudo mkdir /Z
	sudo chmod -R 777 /Z

Upload the PLOSJSE database

	Open phpmyadmin (localhost/phpmyadmin)
	
	Create new database named "PLOSJSE"

	Navigate to PLOSJSE

	Import -> PLOSJSE.SQL

	Update configuration.txt to open PLOSJSE.sql in Elegance.
